# Mobiquity Code Challange
API Automation Framework for testing of Restfull Api

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/akshayamaldhure/jsonplaceholder-typicode-tests.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/aali3305/Mobqtestt)

## Framework Technology  
1. Java 11
2. Maven
3. TestNG
4. REST-assured

## Running the tests
`mvn clean 
 mvn compile 
 mvn test`

## Project Info 
Open the src->Test->Java->Test ( In this Section you have a sufficient further cases)
   1.TC_UserSearchandFindPost
   2.TC_PostNegitiveTests

## Testcases Execution 
You can directly execute the "testng.xml" file and all the testcase will start executing.

## Why Not I chose BDD with Restassured ?

As this task was purely backend i preferred to developed  
a custome Framework using Java and Restassured along with some Pojo approach.
